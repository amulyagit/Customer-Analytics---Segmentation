# Customer-Analytics---Segmentation
A complete end-to-end analytics project that performs customer behavior analysis for data-driven segmentation.

This project focuses on customer segmentation using RFM. This is a technique that groups customers into segments based on their transaction history, using three metrics: 
  - How recently they purchased,
  - How frequently they purchase, and
  - How much they Monetary have spent.

This analysis helps businesses identify valuable customers, understand their behavior, and personalize marketing campaigns to improve engagement and retention. By calculating RFM score for each customer, businesses can segment them into groups like "loyal customers" or "potential churn risks" for targeted strategies.

How segmentation works?

- Score customers: Assign a numerical score (e.g., 1-5) for each of the R, F, and M metrics. A higher score typically represents better performance.
- Create segments: Combine the R, F, and M scores with low score for recency and high scores for frequency and monetary value.
- Target marketing: Develop specific marketing strategies for each segment.
